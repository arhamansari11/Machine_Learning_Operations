-> What is Machine Learning?

- Collect, label, and clean datasets 
- Analyze and visualize data 
- Train and tune ML models 
- Building a production pipeline for machine learning
- Working with AWS ecosystem (Serverless service, Sagemaker, Storage)


1-> Data Sets : 
	Data set is the collection of data. It's maybe in Structured or Unstructured form. 
		e.g : 1-  Mysql is the example of Structured Dataset.   2- MongoDb database is the example of Unstructured Dataset.

2-> Data Streaming :
	Data Streaming refers to the continuos transfer of data from one point to the other in a steady flow.
		Instead of transfer data at once. We transfer data in small peices or chunks.
			Transfer Data in chunks increase the speed , stability , reduces the network error.

	-> FrameWork of Data Streaming :
		1-> Apache Spark
		2-> Apache Flink
		3-> Apache Kafka
			Note : There are many frameworks of Data Streaming but main are these.


3-> Production PipeLine : 
	In Simple words Production PipeLine is a big task that is divided into smaller task and assigned these smaller tasks to the team.
		Production PipeLine are the stages of work 
		e.g : In software Developement there are so many stages. Like : Requirements , Deisgning , Developement , Testing , Hosting , Maintaince
			 Each of these stages involves different professionals and resources working together to bring the project to fruition
